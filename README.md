# WebScrapeByRequestsAndFakeUserAgent

A Python project to scrape websites using the `requests` library and `fake-useragent` for enhanced security. This project includes two scripts:

1. **WebScrapeByProxies.py**: Scrapes websites using free proxies and authenticated requests.
2. **WebScrapeWithoutProxy.py**: Scrapes websites directly without using proxies.

## Features
- Utilizes **proxies** for bypassing restrictions and anonymity.
- Implements **randomized user agents** to mimic real users and avoid detection.
- Supports free proxies from platforms like [Webshare](https://dashboard.webshare.io/).
- Includes fallback for direct requests without proxies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- **IDE**: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- **Environment**: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, use `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install fake-useragent
```

## Files in the Project
1. **WebScrapeByProxies.py**
   - Uses free proxies and random user agents for enhanced security.
   - Saves the scraped content to an HTML file.

2. **WebScrapeWithoutProxy.py**
   - Directly scrapes a website without using proxies.
   - Saves the scraped content to an HTML file.

## Usage
### Running the Scripts
1. **WebScrapeByProxies.py**
   - Update the `proxies_list` with your free proxy details.
   - Replace `proxy_user` and `proxy_password` with your proxy credentials.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python WebScrapeByProxies.py
     ```

2. **WebScrapeWithoutProxy.py**
   - Run the script directly:
     ```bash
     python WebScrapeWithoutProxy.py
     ```

### Expected Output
- The scripts will save the HTML content of the target URLs (`gfgurl` or `economictimes`) to local files:
  - `gfgurlfile.html`
  - `economictimes.html`

## Libraries Used
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): For making HTTP requests to websites.
- [fake-useragent](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/): To generate random user-agent headers for requests.

## Proxy Configuration
- Free proxies can be obtained from [Webshare](https://dashboard.webshare.io/).
- Add proxy details (IP, Port, Username, and Password) in `WebScrapeByProxies.py`.

## Example Code

### WebScrapeByProxies.py
```python
import requests
import time
from fake_useragent import UserAgent

# Example code to use proxies and fake user-agent for scraping
```

### WebScrapeWithoutProxy.py
```python
import requests
import time

# Example code for direct web scraping without proxies
```

## Notes
- Use **proxies** responsibly and ensure compliance with the terms of service of the websites you scrape.
- Add proper error handling for production use.
- Avoid frequent requests to prevent being flagged or blocked by websites.
